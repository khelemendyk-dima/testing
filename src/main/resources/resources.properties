about.text =TestHub was founded in 2018 by a group of friends. Our team is developing in the direction of testing. The goal of this project is to interest people in learning and improve their knowledge in various areas of life. This will help them to be more versatile and make it possible to easily talk about different topics in everyday life. We are trying to improve this project by introducing new features. Currently, we are working on an online chat for users, which should help to have fun between solving tests.
